## Devlog
Kristin Zhang, she/her
Write about how the plan you wrote in the MG1 break-down activity connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.
I connect the number of seeds to _numSeedLeft in Start() function of the Play script and call the PlantCountUI script component to update the text UIs.
And write PlantSeed()function that Instantiates a _PlantPrefab and updates _numSeedLeft with _numSeedPlanted and pass them to UpdateSeed() in PlantCountUI script when called.
